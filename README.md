This is a modified version of Darklandz dRdoor Script to lock doors. I also looked at a couple other scripts that was modified to the original and mixed them all together.

Original Script - https://forum.fivem.net/t/drdoors/57854
MissBehavin's Modified Version - https://github.com/MissBehavin/celldoors
BritishBrotherhood's Modified Verison - https://forum.fivem.net/t/drdoors/57854/128

To Lock/Unlock the doors use this ACE Permission : (add_ace USERGROUP drdoor.unlockdoor allow)  
To Add/Remove doors all locations are found in c_doors.lua

THIS REQUIRES A DATABASE!!!
This syncs with the world so if one door is locked or unlocked it will be the same for all players on the server.
